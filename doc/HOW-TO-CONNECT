This package lets you connect a Linux machine to an ISP that uses PPPoE.
PPPoE is used by many DSL providers and some wireless providers.

Follow these steps and you should have your PPPoE service up and running.

0. Install the rp-pppoe-software
--------------------------------

You should have already done this by the time you're reading this.  If not,
go back and read README.

1. Set up your Ethernet hardware
--------------------------------

First, make sure the Ethernet card you intend to use with the modem is
visible to the Linux kernel.  Just how to do this is beyond the scope
of this document.  However, if the card is the only Ethernet card in
the system, executing:

	ip link show eth0

should display something like this:

	2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 1000
    link/ether fc:aa:15:39:a7:b3 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

Your second line will most definately be different.  As long as you see
the link/ether line, your card should be working.

2. Edit pap-secrets or chap-secrets
-----------------------------------

Edit the "pap-secrets" or "chap-secrets" file, inserting your proper
user-ID and password.  Install the file (or copy the relevant lines)
to /etc/ppp/pap-secrets.  Your ISP may use CHAP authentication.  In
this case, add the line to /etc/ppp/chap-secrets.

3. Create a PPP configuration file
----------------------------------

Create a file called /etc/ppp/peers/NAME where NAME is a convenient name
for the connection.  If you are using user-mode PPPoE, the peer file
should look something like this:

    pty '/usr/sbin/pppoe -s -I eth0'
    sync
    noauth
    remotename YOUR_ISP
    name YOUR_USERNAME
    noipdefault
    nodetach
    noaccomp
    nodeflate
    nopcomp
    novj
    novjccomp
    lcp-echo-interval 10

(Use the appropriate Ethernet interface name in place of eth0, if necessary.)

If you are using kernel-mode PPPoE, the peer file should look something
like this:

    plugin /etc/ppp/plugins/rp-pppoe.so
    nic-eth0
    noauth
    remotename YOUR_ISP
    name YOUR_USERNAME
    noipdefault
    nodetach
    noaccomp
    nodeflate
    nopcomp
    novj
    novjccomp
    lcp-echo-interval 10

Again, adjust nic-eth0 as appropriate for your Ethernet interface.  Always
prefix the interface name with "nic-".

Then to connect, simply invoke:

     pppd call NAME

where NAME is the name of the file you created under /etc/ppp/peers.
